<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Software Development Project:</h2>

- <b>Java</b>
  - [OpenDataPhilly Analysis](https://) <br>
    -	Engineered a Java application to efficiently process and analyze large-scale datasets (10,000+ records) from Philadelphia‚Äôs OpenDataPhilly portal, including COVID-19 statistics, property values, and population demographics.
    -	Developed robust CSV and JSON parsers using JSON.simple, effectively handling real-world data inconsistencies to ensure accurate and reliable data processing.
    -	Designed an intuitive, menu-driven command-line interface for dynamic querying and custom statistical analysis ‚Äì enhancing user experience and data accessibility.
    -	Optimized performance by applying software design patterns (Singleton, Strategy) and memoization techniques ‚Äì reducing query processing times by 60% for repeated data requests.
  - [Social Media Post Analyzer](https://) <br>
    Applied N-tier architecture to develop Java Program that analyzed files of social media posts to identify posts discussing a certain keyword, associate those posts with their nearest location, and identify what locations are ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù based on the volume of posts associated with that location.
  - [Battleship Game](https://) <br>
    Created a human-player vs. computer-player version of Battleship using Java, where the computer places the ships, and the human attempts to sink them. Conducted thorough unit testing with the Junit framework.
- <b>C</b>
  - [Machine Code Assembler & Disassembler] (In progress) <br>
    Wrote C libraries to implement translation from assembly language to binary file and vice versa.
  - [Penn-Shredder] (In progress) <br>
    Implemented a custom shell to manage process execution with runtime restriction, featuring redirection capabilities and a two-stage pipeline for efficient task processing.
- <b>Python</b>
  - [Big Data Analytics & Machine Learning] (In progress) <br>
    Developed a comprehensive program that conducted data preprocessing, combined data frames from different sources, identified correlations, and built predictive models using various classifiers, neural networks, and regression.
  - [Water Tank Game](https://) <br>
    Demonstrated proficiency in creating an interactive user interface, employing efficient data structures for optimal resource management within the game using Python.
- <b>HTML</b>
  - [Making a Website](https://) <br>
    Used Python/HTML to create a program that takes a resume in a simplistic text file and converts it into an HTML file that can be displayed by a web browser.
 
  
<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Quant Project:</h2>

- <b>Python</b>
  - [Algo Trading System](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Package-Delivery-Pathfinding-Algorithm) (In progress) <br>
    Built research to execution trading system consisting of vectorized backtests (VectorBT), paper-trading bot (IBKR), and YAML-based configuration for strategies/data/risk using Python.
- <b>R</b>
  - [S&P 500 Regression Analysis](https://) <br>
    Analyzed and regressed S&P 500 data to visualize and interpret the correlation between stock multiples and price using R.
